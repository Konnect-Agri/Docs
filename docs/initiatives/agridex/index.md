title: Agriculture Data Exchange (AgriDex)
---

Through the [Krushak Odisha](../krushak_odisha/index.md) program we collected the data of almost all farmers in Odisha into a single database. The collection of multiple verified datapoints for every farmer allowed us to build a data exchange platform which shall empower our farmers to share data with entities that can benefit them. For eg: banks, credit lenders, etc.. This led to the formation of the Agricultural Data Exchange (AgriDex) platform. 

Using the AgriDex platform entities can take consent from the farmers for accessing their data. The benefits are as follows: 

For farmers: 
* Granular control of data being shared with external entities
* Digitally share info with entities without having to manage offline / paper documents.

For entities:
* Realtime verified data recieved from farmers

## Use Cases of AgriDex

2. Data consumers in the ecosystem can request for data owners consent to consume data that exists in Krushak Odisha DB for providing services
3. Stores and updates farmer consent for usage of data attributes by requesting party
